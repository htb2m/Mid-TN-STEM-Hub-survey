"7","","An important take away for me was gaining understanding about how students poor behaviors are sometimes a result of their trauma reactions and that we must shape our teaching, counseling, disciplining, etc. in light of that knowledge.","I plan to embed more trauma-informed teaching methods & SEL goals into my academic lesson plans.","","",""

I had worried we were expected to hit everything at once, and the professors helped us navigate better.","It won't change, but I have been very focused on SEL best practices for a few years. It was important to hear I'm doing the right things, and that my reading sources are the correct ones.","","Culturally responsive classrooms, how to navigate when teaching virtually (the SEL components, not the technology), K-2 books to build community and understanding.","I really enjoyed the PDs.

The whole LARGE group was very much on the same page and the strategies, ideas, and support was amazing.  I would not change a thing. ","Trauma affects everyone differently.  And what is traumatic to one may not be to another.","I am already started with my planning for next school year.

"27","Tuesday’s workshop could have worked in STEM applications as well.","Strategies used with students experiencing multiple traumas was impactful.","I will be more mindful to implement these strategies as it became my focus during this informative PD.","As all educators now we are uncertain as how we will address Covid 19 concerns and how this might impact our teaching.

"47","I did enjoy the breakout session portion, and liked coming up with ideas to include SEL into some of our standards. I would have enjoyed a little more time at the end to hear each group’s project.","I love the idea of having a attendance question, where the student can choose to answer the question or say pass, rather than just “here” or “present.”  This sounds like a good way to hear the voice of each child which may give me clues into how they are doing that day.","I plan to be intentional about checking in with every student every day, to make sure they are doing OK emotionally.","There are so many unknowns about what our school year will look like. I am curious how we will serve the SE needs of our kids if we end up in a fully remote-learning situation. ","I would like to continue learning about non-traditional teaching models. This could be powerful to use in a remote learning situation, or even in a traditional classroom to free me up to work with the kids more individually.","I enjoyed the workshop, thank you for providing such a timely and necessary information-filled workshop. What a world we are living in today!"
"48","None- it was great!","I loved the opportunity to break out into small groups- I didn't even know that was possible in Zoom- and it was extremely helpful to hear about other educators' experiences so far during this and possible future school closures.","I will be sure to be more mindful of my students' mental state and non-academic needs prior to just jumping into my science content as usual.","How to support students if we have to switch back and forth between online and in-person classes?","Anything related to effectively teaching online","I was so impressed with the presenters' knowledge on taking care of the whole-student, and it really put a lot of things into perspective coming from a social with an array of SE groups.

"49","I would extend the time by 30 minutes in each of the workshop days.","Trauma can cause people to behave differently and must be acknowledged and dealt with. It is critical that we as educators attend to learning as not only cognitive in nature but also: behavioral, cultural, affective, political, historical, and ethical.","I will be setting aside planning and teaching time to address trauma.

"50","There was just 1 incident, but it wasn't the presenter's fault. Her internet must not have been strong enough because the presenter(s) disappeared for the first 2 minutes of the 1st session. Then they came back and started their lesson. But it was very awkward to sit in a silent meeting because the teachers got kicked off of the meeting.
