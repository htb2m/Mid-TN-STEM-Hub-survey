"1","More time.  We ran out of time.  Perhaps more resources to explore. ","Many ELL students cannot express what they want to say and many times, just wont.","By seeking alternative ways for students to express their understanding of learning, with a focus on ELL students.  Not just ways to present knowledge at the end of study but during the study. ","How to communicate better with ELL students when no one else speaks their language. ","Related Arts classes (have each class a limited amount of time each school year)- How to make a better connection with your students. ","Thank you for the time and effort it took to put this together. Thank you"

"4","The videos were very helpful; ability to view the video, especially the last video longer would have been welcomed.","Importance of allowing students “think time” and to create a culture of appreciating how to figure out the answer versus finding the answer. ","The concept of figuring out versus finding out will change my practice. ","Inventing words; I am unclear regarding this concept. ","SEL",""
"5","It could have been a little longer to allow for the question and answer sessions without running over.  I was unable to stay afterwards because I had to get my son.  ","The videos watching students use various communication skills and their native language was very impactful as it gave me an opportunity to see what I should be looking for in my own students.","I will be sure to build a stronger relationship with our EL teacher so I can make sure I am accessing every resource possible for my future EL students.  ","What do typical assessments look like in very diverse classes?  I have never had more than one or two EL student in a class, but would love to see how other teachers assess a multilingual group.","Anything related to differentiation in a virtual setting since it is likely we will be teaching online at some point next year.  ","I appreciate the opportunity to attend these workshops without having to pay for them!  Thank you!"

"7","I had a very difficult time responding on the Google documents.  I did not know how use them nor did anyone in my breakout group.  We shared verbally.  At the end, one person in my group figured out what to do.","Make sure tools to support multilingual students are not tools for students who need remedial help.","I am going to make sure I give multilingual students the opportunity to ""show"" what they know. They know more than they can say.  I needed to be reminded of that.","How do I work around time constraints and mandates?","",""

"9","None at this time","I took away the idea that multilingual students know more about science even though they may not know the vocabulary and language to express their knowledge","I am working on adding PBL's , phenomona, and more hands-on activities to engage those multilingual students and the other students in science.","None at this time","Nothing at this time","No, thank you."
"10","I would extend the time by 30 minutes in each of the workshop days.","Trauma can cause people to behave differently and must be acknowledged and dealt with. It is critical that we as educators attend to learning as not only cognitive in nature but also: behavioral, cultural, affective, political, historical, and ethical.","I will be setting aside planning and teaching time to address trauma. I will be setting aside planning a teaching time to better address the specific needs of the bilingual learners in my class.","Are there specific books and online resources you suggest for lesson planning taking trauma and bilingual learners?","Project planning and planning for supporting those experiencing trauma.",""
"11","More strategies or solutions to reach bilingual students would have been helpful.  Then instead of awkward silent moments open discussion would have been helpful as well.","Provide the time for bilingual learners to share in your classroom and value their combination of speech, gestures and diagrams to effectively communicate ideas.","I will communicate to parents how I value the effort their child is making to participate in the classroom.  Then I will communicate these efforts to our school's ESL teacher.","How can I modify the work for bilingual learners?  When students are pulled from the room by their ESL teacher, how can I continually keep them informed on the lessons they have missed?  How can we motivate parents to ensure their students  attend school regularly, study, and complete their homework.?  Should all bilingual students have their grades modified?","Literacy","I enrolled in the other MIDTNSTEM workshop and have not received my PD's.  I filled out two surveys and several days have gone by.  If I have done something wrong I would hope someone would email me about this."
"12","We always needed more time in our breakout groups, not only to complete the task but also to converse wit fellow educators.  sometimes within that time you can learn more than intended just by talking with a fellow teacher. ","The most impactful take away I had wass not to dumb down the content just because my student has limitiations on their understanding of the English language.","I think I will be incorporating more voice and choice in my classroom, but also a higher level of respect for the bilingual student.","","",""
